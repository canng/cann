  description: Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City were investigated for urbanization and climate change. • Temperature extremes, urban expansion, and surface urban heat island were compared. • Nocturnal warming was significantly observed from 1990 to 2020. • Urbanization shifts landscape metrics and aggravates urban heat island. • Ho Chi Minh City is more vulnerable due to urbanization and microclimate changes.
