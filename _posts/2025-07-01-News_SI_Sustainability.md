I am currently editing a Special Issue for Sustainability on **"Designing Resilient Cities: Landscape-Based Architecture and Green Space Strategies for Urban Sustainability"**, together with:

🔹 Dr. Nigel K. Downes (Can Tho University, Vietnam)

🔹 Dr. Olabisi S. Obaitor (LMU Munich, Germany)

This SI explores how landscape architecture, green space planning, and urban nature can contribute to climate-responsive, sustainable, and equitable urban development, particularly across the Global South. 

We welcome contributions on green-blue infrastructure, nature-based solutions, urban informatics, and interdisciplinary approaches to advance urban climate resilience and social equity.
