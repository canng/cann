> <p style="font-size:20px"> Eastern Thailand and Rayong province face perennial drought and water scarcity due to natural characteristics of climate and geology. Therefore, increasing water surface by man-made reservoirs is one of the priorities in the regional development plan to provide water adequately for industrial purposes, domestic consumption, and agriculture. The large reservoir constructions may induce land use, land cover changes (LULCC), yet it also is expected to alleviate the drought harshness in the region. By delineating Landsat satellite images and spatial analysis, this study revealed the LULCC in Rayong from 1990 to 2020. The most prominent LULCC was surface water expansion, about 10.9% per year, yet the increase was the most substantial in the first decade rather than the last two decades. Vegetation expansion was observed, contributing to an increase in forests/plantations and intensified agriculture by 39.19% and 25.54%, respectively. The LULCC corresponded to a 3.64% increase in ecosystem service values (ESV), implying positive benefits from the LULCC. Vegetation drought conditions monitored by the vegetation health index (VHI) exhibited an improvement trend, especially in the eastern basins. The development of artificial reservoirs was proven to stimulate the expansion of intensive agriculture and vegetation drought mitigation with spatial heterogeneity, spreading mainly across areas of the basins rather than remote areas. The research findings inform the efficiency of the reservoirs and irrigation systems regarding the beneficial effects on drought mitigation and water scarcity for agricultural cultivation. They also provide spatial information on areas still hindered by water problems that should be addressed in future strategies.</p>
