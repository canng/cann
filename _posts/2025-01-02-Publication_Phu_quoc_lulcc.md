> <p style="font-size:20px"> Dynamic development of tourism activities and rapid urbanisation in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) can lead to significant land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) and environmental degradation, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas. This study examines the transformation of land use and its associated impacts on habitat quality and thermal environment in Phu Quoc Island (Vietnam) over a 20-year period (2003â€“2023). Using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and random forest classification, we quantify LULCCs and assess the environmental consequences of urban expansion on habitat degradation and intensification of the islandâ€™s thermal environment, focusing on land surface temperature (LST) changes. Our analysis reveals that rapid urbanisation, driven by large-scale tourism and infrastructure developments, has led to a significant loss of forest and farmland, leading to a 5.6% decline in habitat quality and a marked increase in LST. The study also highlights the uneven distribution of urban growth, with the majority of expansion occurring in the southern and central regions of the island. By applying the InVEST Habitat Quality Model, we identify key zones of habitat degradation and offer insights into the spatial patterns of environmental sensitivity and changes. Our findings underscore the need for integrated land use planning and sustainable development strategies to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of SEZ-driven urbanisation on island ecosystems. This research provides critical guidance for policymakers, planners, and environmental managers to balance economic growth with environmental conservation in fragile island environments.</p>
